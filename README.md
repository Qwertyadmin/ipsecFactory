Based on [OpenWrt documentation](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/services/vpn/strongswan/roadwarrior).


## Features

- Automates deployment and provisiong of IPsec IKEv2 VPN with certificate authentication on OpenWrt router.
- Support multiple client - including iOS - and both pubkey and EAP-TLS authentication scheme.
- Uses local DHCP server for client IP configuration
- Can generate more client certificate after first server installation.
- Tested on OpenWrt 19.07 SNAPSHOT.

- clients: Required. Common Name for clients' certificate. If multiple client certificates have to be issued encase in quotes. Example: --clients 'client1 client2'
- dhcp: Required. IP of local DHCP server for address allocation. Accept also network broadcast address (192.168.1.255) or broadcast address (255.255.255.255)
- capassword: Required. Password for CA keys bundle
- clientpassword: Required. Password for client certificate bundle. This password will only be required to install certificate and key, not for IPsec authentication.
- country: Country for certificate issueing. Defaults to 'US'

 --country CH --caname yourCA --orgname yourOrganization
```
